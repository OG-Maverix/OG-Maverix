### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

WHAT IS OGX ABOUT?

MUSIC

Music is the mission. OGX uses Blockchain and Web3 Technologies
to empower musicians, fans and music businesses both small and large.
The goal, to help those whose lives revolve around music.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

OGX is building custom Smart Contracts, created on many different blockchain platforms, that are tailored specifically to
the needs of artists navigating their careers in music. It is designed to be a dynamic, powerful and profitable platform
for artists to host their music, while also helping alleviate the strain of managing the business aspects that come with it.

The OGX Platform is the integration of all the different OGX technologies and Smart Contract Controls for the artist.
Putting Music-Metadata (On-chain), Proof-of-Production (On-chain) and giving Artists Full-Auditability over their work is our goal.


PRODUCER  
SINGER  
SONGWRITER  
ENGINEER  
MUSICIAN  
BAND  
COMPOSER  
ARTIST +

CONTRIBUTOR

Upload a Single, Remix, EP or Album... Set your Artists and Contributors...
Choose how everyone will receive compensation, either by Payout or Royalties...
And manage your music in real-time with the OGX Platform

Select how many Producers, Singers, Songwriters, Engineers and Musicians etc,
contributed to creating the musical piece...

By default, every contract starts with one producer. From there, you can choose
exactly the number and type of additional artists that also contributed to the piece.

ARTIST + was created so that any artist or contributor who does not fall into one
of the normal categories can also receive compensation for their work

SINGLE
REMIX
EP
ALBUM

SAMPLE
STEM
SAMPLEPACK
STEMPACK

The CONTRIBUTOR section of our contracts are set by the artist, so you are in
full controll of your music, and who profits from it

Real-time data from your Smart Contracts and the Blockchain are fed to your Dashboard
so you can see how a song is performing, and so each Artist and Contributor
can keep track of and audit their compensation in real-time without the need of a third party

Samplepack and Stempack contracts are similar to Single, Remix, EP and Album contracts
in that they also allow the artist to chose their own compensation for the work, as well as
give compensation to contributors of the packs

BUILD NOTES

OG Maverix is currently bringing the project online, and will be operating in Beta-Release Version 01.0, and subesequent BR-Versions, until testing is complete. During this time, we encourage
people to experiment with the system and get a feel for the project and what it is becoming, but please do not put any data on the system that is not backed up on your personal devices until our
testing is complete and we release our first full-fledged version of OGX.

Everyone is welcome to experiment with the system and provide feedback. We will also be selecting a small number of individuals to help us test the system consistently while also providing us
with consistent feedback throughout the process. Help us build the future of music for everyone who lives and breathes it, every day.

In the future, we hope to also serve as an R&D platform for music technology, bridging the gap between what was possible with music tech, and what is now possible as these new tools
musicians and artists have at their disposal are being created.

OGX will provide an official monthly report, including build notes to the community detailing the work that has taken place on the platform, what work is currently being focused on by the OGX Team, and the systems that have been brought online for testing by the public.

Again, we cannot state enough how important it is that any data put on the system during testing is backed up on your other devices. We will be resetting some systems ourselves to provide clean slates for either brand-new test iterations, or to put that specific system online for the general public to start using it.

Please be patient with us throughout the process as this is brand-new technology we are developing and implementing. We hope that as you explore the system, you will start to see the possibilities this new technology can afford musicians, producers and really all of us in the music space.

Created by artists, for artists.
