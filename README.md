### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

OG Maverix is currently bringing the project online, and will be operating in Beta-Release Version 01.0, and subesequent BR-Versions, until testing is complete. During this time, we encourage
people to experiment with the system and get a feel for the project and what it is becoming, but please do not put any data on the system that is not backed up on your personal devices until our
testing is complete and we release our first full-fledged version of OGX.

Everyone is welcome to experiment with the system and provide feedback. We will also be selecting a small number of individuals to help us test the system consistently while also providing us
with consistent feedback throughout the process. Help us build the future of music for everyone who lives and breathes it, every day.

In the future, we hope to also serve as an R&D platform for music technology, bridging the gap between what was possible with music tech, and what is now possible as these new tools
musicians and artists have at their disposal are being created.

BUILD NOTES

OGX will provide an official monthly report, including build notes to the community detailing the work that has taken place on the platform, what work is currently being focused on by the OGX Team, and the systems that have been brought online for testing by the public.

Again, we cannot state enough how important it is that any data put on the system during testing is backed up on your other devices. We will be resetting some systems ourselves to provide clean slates for either brand-new test iterations, or to put that specific system online for the general public to start using it.

Please be patient with us throughout the process as this is brand-new technology we are developing and implementing. We hope that as you explore the system, you will start to see the possibilities this new technology can afford musicians, producers and really all of us in the music space.
